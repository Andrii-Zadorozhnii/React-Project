Requirements: </br>Create a program for the Marvel library. Show all the characters when the user opens the page. The user should be able to search for a character. When a user clicks on a character in the list, load information about the character and display it either in a modal window or in another way. The user should also be able to choose a theme for the app - dark or light. Think about the color scheme or analyze ready-made palettes.
